# Eat-Da-Burger! 
Is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.  
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* This app utilizes Sequelize, Mysql, Node, Express, Handlebars.
* Follows the MVC design pattern.
* Use Node and Sequelize to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
